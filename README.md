# discourse-sort-by-topic-title
A plugin for Discourse. Adds the option to sort by topic titles.

Translated to English and German

## Possible issues
As the raw template for topic-list-header is changed to reflect being able to sort by title, other plugins or themes modifying this file might break the functionality or be broken themselves.
